"@type": "Answer",
"text": "The price of carpets is influenced by factors like the quality of the fiber and expensive options, as while cheaper carpets may seem affordable, they often lack durability, potentially necessitating frequent replacements, whereas choosing high-quality carpets with a premium underlay can offer a more long-lasting and durable solution."

<div class="collapse" id="collapse2" aria-labelledby="heading2" data-parent="#faqAccordion">
<div class="card-body"><p>The age factor becomes crucial; if your carpet exceeds 12-15 years without regular professional cleaning, replacement may be necessary as conditions like filter soiling, crushing, and traffic patterns can have significantly deteriorated the carpet, and a single cleaning cannot reverse decades of wear.</p>

<div class="collapse" id="collapse4" aria-labelledby="heading4" data-parent="#faqAccordion">
<div class="card-body"><p>The price of carpets is influenced by factors like the quality of the fiber and expensive options, as while cheaper carpets may seem affordable, they often lack durability, potentially necessitating frequent replacements, whereas choosing high-quality carpets with a premium underlay can offer a more long-lasting and durable solution.</p>
